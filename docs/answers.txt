#4:
- Allow for parallel development
- Provide a way to isolate experimenta/unstable changes from main codebase

#5:
git log shows history of commits like the commit messages, authros, and timestamps
git status shows the state of the directory such as modified files, untracked files, and which branch you're on

#8:
- Inheritance: means by which a class can share its data (attributes or properties) and behaviour (methods) with a subclass
- Encapsulation: A way to restrict the direct access to some components of an object,
                 so users cannot access state values for all of the variables of a particular object
- Polymorphism: The ability of a programming language to interpret objects in different ways based on their class or data type

#9:
The main difference between the "Dictator and Lieutenants" workflow and the "Integration Manager" workflow is in how they handle 
decision-making and integration. In the "Dictator and Lieutenants" model, there is a hierarchical structure with a central authority 
(the Dictator) and trusted teams (Lieutenants) responsible for specific areas, making decisions and merging changes.
In contrast, the "Integration Manager" model relies on a single Integration Manager who reviews and integrates contributions from
contributors with direct write access limited to the Integration Manager, simplifying the decision-making process.

#10:
 By establishing a structured and organized hierarchy that can effectively manage the complexity of a large-scale project. 
 This approach allows for more fine-grained control and specialization.
